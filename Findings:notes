Findings/notes

Training data:
2656 total tweets.
828 about danger, 1828 not about danger.
The minimum length of a danger tweet in my training set is 46 characters.
The minimum length of any tweet in my training set is 14. Cutting all new tweets 
shorter than 14 chars.

Danger tweets may come mostly from "official" accounts, so you need to compare
them to other tweets coming from those same accounts. To do this, grab a random
tweet from each account that sent out a danger tweet and use those as controls,
instead of using random tweets as controls. This way you don't have to worry
about spam, or about controlling for follower counts.

I did a "manual" search for tweets with the phrases "very dangerous" and "super dangerous"
and the hashtags #warning and #alert.
First time I did this search was may 26th.
